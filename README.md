# Wine-Quality-Statistical-Analysis
Statistical analysis of physicochemical properties of red and white wines to predict wine quality using R, including EDA, correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression modelling.

This project presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of wine quality based on physicochemical properties. Acting as a statistical consultant for a wine supplier, the goal of this analysis is twofold:

To determine whether physicochemical attributes can be used to predict wine quality.

To assess whether wine quality and physicochemical characteristics differ between red and white wine varieties.

The analysis is conducted in R and follows a structured statistical workflow including exploratory data analysis, correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression modelling.
